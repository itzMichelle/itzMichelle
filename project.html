      <h2 class='menu'>One of the projects I'm most proud of is my 'eating green' project which is a menu targeted for
        vegans. I came up with my layout by organizing images that could catch the attention of the buyer, vegans, and
        making the text smaller than the images but still readable. My layout matches my target audience because it
        includes images of the desired food and it’s ingredients. The images are organized with the recipe so the buyer
        can see what they’re ordering and possibly catch their attention. </h2>

    <h2 class='culprit1'>For this project, I decided to come up with a topic that had to do with investigating because at the time I really enjoyed watching serial crime documentaries. I came up with a story that would have a different ending for each option with the use of buttons. I wanted to make the ending a mystery which can either lead up to your death or finding the culprit.  </h2>

    <h2 class=subject1>This project was a mini project I was working on with the use of inputs which took me the least amount of time to complete.  You'll get a different outcome or subject depending if you say yes or no. This would determine whether you prefer math or english.</h2>
