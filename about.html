<h2 class='aboutme'>Throughout my sophmore year in Highschool, I got to learn new ways to use html, css and javascript. I've created projects of my own like my menu project, adventure game and my mini project and presented them in class. So far, I've learned how to create buttons, inputs, borders, add images, add links, style and etc. The most difficult part of creating my projects was trying to figure out why my buttons weren't working or why something wasn't changing. However, through my experience with computer science I have improved my problem solving methods as well as engaging with other classmates. My favorite part about being in computer science is decorating my project and creating a color theme for it. I always try out new ways to improve my projects and try to match my target audience. Depite facing obstacles, I'm still up for new experiences and obstacles I have to face with the use of computer science. </h2>
